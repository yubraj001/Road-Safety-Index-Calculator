This is a Python-based program that calculates a Road Safety Index based on various factors
like road condition, traffic density,weather condition, speed limit, road type, and accident
history. It outputs a safety score and indicates whether the road is safe or dangerous.



I am going to describe you step by step:


1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yubraj001/Road-Safety-Index-Calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd Road-Safety-Index-Calculator

3. Run the Python script:
python road_safety_calculator.py


Once you run the program, it will prompt you for the following inputs:

Road condition: Choose from clear, slippery, wet, or icy.
Traffic density: Choose from low, moderate, or high.
Weather condition: Choose from sunny, rainy, or foggy.
Speed limit: Enter the speed limit (in km/h).
Road type: Choose from highway, city, or rural.
Accident history: Enter the number of accidents in the past year.
After entering the inputs, the program will calculate the safety index and display the safety level like below.


"RESULT"

Road is dangerous with a Safety Index of 45/100.
